The entire data set was used to perform the experiment.

Steps:
1.Open Eclipse
2.Create new java project
3.Use default location
4.Browse to the CS584-pedhara folder and select it


***doc2mat****
1. The input is taken from data.txt
2. Output is given to out.txt
3. Every document in output is separated by {} in out.txt
4. The class name of a document is saved within the matrix with value -1. So it is not used in any similarity search.
5. While running the program please change the run configuration as the default heap size of JVM is not enough for the program.
6. The run configuration can be changed by
	Go to Run -> Click on Run configuration -> select doc2mat from Java application on the left window -> click on arguments tab -> add -Xmx1024m in the VM arguments field and run.

***cosine*****
1. The input is taken from data.txt
2. This file performs only one query similarity test at a time.
3. The output is given on the console.
4. For testing on the full data set refer to "testcosine.txt"

***euclidean****
1. The input is taken from data.txt
2. This file performs only one query similarity test at a time.
3. The output is given on the console.
4. For testing on the full data set refer to "testeuclidean.txt"
